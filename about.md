<h3>Hi,</h3>

My name is [Lahiru Pathirage]("http://lahiru.site"), a full-stack developer from Sri Lanka.
I designed the `Materialized`, a simple and clean Jekyll template using AngularJS 1.5.x and Angular material 1.1.x stack just for fun.


Fork it from [here]("https://github.com/lpsandaruwan/materialized").<br>
If you have any issue, please feel free to submit it [here]("https://github.com/lpsandaruwan/materialized/issues/new").

<br>
Please enjoy!
